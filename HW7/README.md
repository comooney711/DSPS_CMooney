## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:

Ensured PEP8 compliance.

### Ben Flaggs:
Assisted in preprocessing data. Calculated intracluster variance. Applied k-means clustering and plotted variance over number of clusters. Plotted k-means clusters on 2d projection.

### Nik Korzoun:

Assisted with intracluster variance and plotting variance over number of clusters. Created distance matrix, histogram of pairwise distances, and applied DBSCAN clustering to 2d TSNE projection.

### Connor Mooney:
Preprocessed the data. Plotted the TSNE projection. Created agglomerative clustering dendrograms and 2D agglomerative clusters plot.


## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**
This homework was about understanding and applying different clustering methods to a large, multi-dimensional data set. 


2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**
The hardest part about the homework for me was determining how to .........


3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**


  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
