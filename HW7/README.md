## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

This homework was about applying different models to data to manually find the fit parameters, then comparing how well they fit.
  
2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

The hardest part of the homework was understanding how to apply a quadratic fit with just the information on the linear fit.
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

The easiest part of he homework was question 4. Once I understand exactly what the question was asking me to do it was only algebra to prove the mean value T.
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**

I have learned how to insert images into a google colab document. I have also learned how to apply linear algebra tools in python.
