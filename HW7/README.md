## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:

Ensured PEP8 compliance. Assisted with debugging.

### Ben Flaggs:
Assisted in preprocessing data. Calculated intracluster variance. Applied k-means clustering and plotted variance over number of clusters. Plotted k-means clusters on 2d projection.

### Nik Korzoun:

Assisted with intracluster variance and plotting variance over number of clusters. Created distance matrix, histogram of pairwise distances, and applied DBSCAN clustering to 2d TSNE projection.

### Connor Mooney:
Preprocessed the data. Plotted the TSNE projection. Created agglomerative clustering dendrograms and 2D agglomerative clusters plot.


## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**
This homework was about understanding and applying different clustering methods to a large, multi-dimensional data set. We also used different methods to determine the ideal number of clusters to apply to our data.


2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**
The hardest part about the homework for me was understanding how DBSCAN clustering effectively determines clusters conceptually.


3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**
The easiest part of the homework was preprocessing the data. Removing the non-values and whitening the datasets was straightforward.

  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
I learned many new things in this lab. I would say everything in this lab was new for me. For example, I learned that the best number of clusters to create is when the total intracluster variance decreases the most from the last number of clusters, compared to the next number of clusters.
