# HW2 README

## Contributions
Andrew Crossman drafted BoltzmannDistribution.ipynb, found means of the histograms and compared to analytic values, then consulted formatting for PEP8. Ben Flaggs set the seeds for reproducability, and was responsible for verifying physics, writing Gaussian functions and fitting to distributions. Nik Korzoun tested and bugfixed CentralLimitTheorem.ipynb, captioned figures and maintained code branches. Connor Mooney plotted means as a function of sample sizes for varying distributions, and generated histograms of all distribution sample means.

## Questions
1) This homework was about learning how to plot different distributions and understanding how the central limit theorem applies with increasing sample size. This is to nuumerically prove the central limit theorem that we had learned about in class.

2) The hardest part of the homework was trying to iterate through a numpy array without it skipping repeated values. For example, if there were 5 elements of the array with a sample size of 20, it was difficult to get the program the loop to not only choose one element of value 20.

3) The easiest part of the homework was mainly the Boltzmann python file in general. It was asking fairly simple conceptual questions and asking to label axes.

4) I learned that a Cauchy sequence has no mean or variance, and thus it does not follow central limit theorem.
