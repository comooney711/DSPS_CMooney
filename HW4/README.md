# HW 4

## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:

*Derived the 'V^2 = 1/r' dependence on the velocity for a Newtonian framework of the galactic curve.*

*Developed the code to answer problem 1 in in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf) and ensured that it was PEP8 compliant.*

### Ben Flaggs:

*Read in and Cleaned up the galaxy data*

*Derived the angular and physical size of M31 through computational analysis*

*Drafted the `getradii` function*

### Nik Korzoun:

*Drafted the `vratios` function*

*Created the plots for the MW galaxy*

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

This homework was created to prove that galaxies do not follow expected Newtonian behavior, and that there must be more mass than is able to be observed by light. This was done by analyzing the trend of the rotation curve of two galaxies past their observable radii. Finally, we applied Monte Carlo sampling to a distribution to find its moments over increasing sample size. This additional exercise was to prove the validity of the MC method and to illustrate an example of the Central Limit Theorem.
  
2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

The hardest part of the homework was to compute the vairance and kurtosis. This was especailly frustrating for computing the true variance, which is a simple function.
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

The easiest part was making style changes to my plots once I was able to get the data to plot correctly. This is always one of the most enjoyable parts of coding to me.
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
I have learned that kurtosis is how heavy the tails of a distribution are, with a value of zero being a normal distribution.
