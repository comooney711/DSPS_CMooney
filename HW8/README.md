## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Ensured PEP8 compliance. Explored and cleaned dataset. Adjusted parameters to ensure good scores.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created and fit with classifiers. Found four most important features. Some captions and descriptions made.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created confusion matrices. Assisted with fitting training data and testing scores with test data. Some captions and descriptions made.
### Connor Mooney:
Created loss functions. Assisted in finding beset four features. Plotted ROC curve. Some captions and descriptions made.

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**
This homework was about finding the best features out of a list of 30 to discriminate higgs boson decay from two other background events. To do this we used random forest and gradient boosted decision tree classifiers and regressors upon our data.

2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**
The hardest part of the homework was trying to conceptually understand what a decision tree is doing to our data.

3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**
The easiest part of the homework was to plot the ROC curve since the code was already written.
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
I have learned that increasing the max depth of our decision trees greatly boosted our test data score.
