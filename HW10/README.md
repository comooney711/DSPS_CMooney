## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Imported, cleaned, and reshaped headshot images of training and test data for headshot assignment.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created loss vs epoch plots for digit assignment, created model using FFNN to reconstruct images of digits, and created figure captions for FFNN digit assignment.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created loss vs epoch plots for headshot assignment, created model with a given loss function and optimizer, and added many figure captions for headshot assignment.

### Connor Mooney:
Imported, cleaned, and reconstructed headshot image of Connor's headshot. Added some captions for headshot assignment.

## Questions
1. This homework is about using neural network to encode our images to a lower dimensional representation of our images, and then decoding that latent distribution to reconstruct an equal or higher resolution image.
2. The hardest part of this homework was trying to figure out the best loss function and optimizer to use to reconstruct the faces.
3. The easiest part of this homework was importing, cleaning, and lower the resolution of the headshots for reconstruction.
4. I learned that neural networks require a large amount of training data and a large amount of understanding oon how to adjust the hyperparameters in order to create accurate predictions.
