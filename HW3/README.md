# HW 3
## Contributions
Members of this group were Andrew Crossman, Ben Flaggs (myself), Nik Korzoun, and Connor Mooney. Andrew Crossman made plot labels, checked the notebook for errors, then consulted formatting for PEP8. Ben Flaggs retrieved the data set from the SCEDC earthquake catalog, assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting valuable data, assisted in making the histograms in the data exploration section, and aided with understanding of the pseudocode. Nik Korzoun implemented the KS test, remade Fig. 1 and Table 1 from [Corral 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf), and maintained code branches. Connor Mooney also assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting valuable data, assisted in making histograms and aided with understanding of the pseudocode.

## Questions
1. This homework was used to get familiar with using the pandas package to manipulate large amounts of data and achieve statistical results, specifcally by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The goal of the assignment was to learn about the statistical test and reproduce the results from [Corral 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf), determining if there is a significant correlation between the magnitiude of earthquakes and the period of time between them.

2. The most difficult part of this homework assignment was being able to understand the details of the KS test, and how to put it into practice with a real datset. The pseudocode was a great guide to help understand the process of applying the KS test.

3. The easiest part of this homework was importing and cleaning the data from the Earthquake Catelog website (http://service.scedc.caltech.edu/eq-catalogs/poly.php), since we had already gone over it in class.

4. Most of everything in this notebook was a learning point for me. More specifically, I now know what a dataframe object is, and how you can use its methods to clean and retrieve one's code. Such as using the broadcast technique to filter out elements in an array of my dataframe object with whatever condition I choose.
