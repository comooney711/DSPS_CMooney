The figures above are flux correlation plots fitted by a simple power law function between two different energy bands. The first plot has several issues. There is no legend (and thus too much whitespace), the automatic displayed range slightly truncates the y-axis (making plot misleading), and there are more graphical elements than there are features (only color is needed to differentiate different dates). These issues are all fixed in the second plot.
